Post Your Dish at Foorum -- A Platform for Food Sharing

I will build a web platform for people to share the food they eat in different places. Main functions include live posting of images and categorizing them into galleries.

The Posting page allows users to post their images, as well as to like and comment others’ live posts. Every post has an optional single-line text comment, and two mandatory fields to input: a selection field to choose the cuisine by region, and a real-time location field to indicate the restaurant. Users can also click on others’ profile, which directs them to a page where all history posts of this user are shown. 

The Gallery page categorizes images in the post section and displays the 10 highest like dishes for each cuisines. These images update automatically based on the live numbers of likes a image gets. The main page will contains blocks of food animation and simple introductory texts using HTML/CSS design. The menu bar, live posting, getting locations, and AJAX updates of gallery will demonstrate Javascript interactivity features. Finally, storing the number of likes and uploading pictures from local file would involve backend data management/processing(PHP).
